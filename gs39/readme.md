# LimitOffsetPagination

This pagination style mirrors the syntax used when looking up multiple database records. The client includes both a "limit" and an "offset" query parameter. The limit indicates the maximum number of items to return, and is equivalent to the page_size in other styles. The offset indicates the starting position of the query in relation to the complete set of unpaginated items.
